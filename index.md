## About Me

I am a PhD student in NUS IDS&SoC work with [Bryan Hooi](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/bhooi/), [See Kiong Ng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/) and  [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/)(NTU). Previously I visisted [UCL WI group](https://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and AI centre. Before that I worked as a R&D engineer in natural language processing working with [Prof. Zhang Richong](http://act.buaa.edu.cn/zhangrc/), affiliated with [BDBC](http://bdbc.buaa.edu.cn/?lang=zh) and [Computer Science College](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) in [Beihang University](www.buaa.edu.cn). My current research interests lie in LLM applications on task-oriented dialogue system, reasoning and calibration capability of LLM, as well as the LLM-powered Agent.
