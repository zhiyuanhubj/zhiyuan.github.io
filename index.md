## About Me

I am a PhD student in NUS IDS&SoC work with [Bryan Hooi](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/bhooi/) and  [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/)(NTU). Meanwhile, I am visisting [UCL WI group](https://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) cooperating with [Aldo Lipani](https://aldolipani.com/). Previously, I worked as a R&D engineer in natural language processing working with [Prof. Zhang Richong](http://act.buaa.edu.cn/zhangrc/), affiliated with [BDBC](http://bdbc.buaa.edu.cn/?lang=zh) and [Computer Science College](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) in [Beihang University](www.buaa.edu.cn). My current research interests lie in Text Generation, Dialogue System and LLM. You can also find me in [Google Scholar Personal Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gQ1t5EUAAAAJ)
