## About Me

I am a R&D engineer in natural language processing working with [Prof. Zhang Richong](http://act.buaa.edu.cn/zhangrc/), affiliated with [BDBC](http://bdbc.buaa.edu.cn/?lang=zh) and [Computer Science College](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) in [Beihang University](www.buaa.edu.cn). Prior to that, I obtained B.Eg. from Beijing University of Chemical Technology. My current research interests lie in Information Extraction and Question Answering. You can also find me in [Google Scholar Personal Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gQ1t5EUAAAAJ)
